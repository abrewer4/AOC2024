# AOC2024

My attempt at Advent of Code 2024

## Aims

- Complete each challenge using Python
- Write code that is easy to read and follow

Very little thought will be given to optimising performance in my solutions unless my approach is so awfully slow that I don't want to wait for the output.

Each solution will be my own approach - Feel free to read and/use, but do not assume that anything you find here consitutes best practice :)
