# AOC2024

My attempt at Advent of Code 2024 - using **Python**

## Aims

- Complete each challenge using Python
- Write code that is easy to read and follow
- Learn new ways to approach different problems

### Disclaimer

~Very little~ _No_ thought will be given to optimal performance in my solutions. My priority to write clear, readable code, using beginner-friendly functions and approaches where possible.

Each solution will be my own approach - Feel free to read and/use, but do not assume that anything you find here consitutes best practice :)
